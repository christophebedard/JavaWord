# JavaWord

Microsoft Word as a Java "IDE"

![](./example.gif)

## Setup

Set the path to Java's `\bin` (at the top in the macro).

## Use

Of course, make sure your Word document has the same name as your Java class!

To build and run, simply click the "run icon" (triangle) in the quick access toolbar (top left, next to save/undo/redo).
